# KODAC KDO H4-R4B Phase-B Server-Side Atomic Gate Authorization

Date: 2026-08-22
Status: AUTHORIZATION_CANDIDATE / DOCS_ONLY / NO_RULESET_MUTATION / NO_APP_INSTALLATION / NO_WORKFLOW_MUTATION / NO_TRUST_ROOT_ESTABLISHMENT

## 1. Purpose

Authorize the smallest safe design predecessor required by canonical PR #146 before the founder process-authority trust root may be established.

Canonical PR #146 proved that a client-side finalizer plus `expected_head_sha` cannot by itself make review/comment/thread metadata atomic with the merge operation. This document therefore selects a server-enforced architecture that moves merge-critical mutable predicates into GitHub's protected-branch / ruleset / merge-queue control plane and moves Kodac-specific founder/reviewer bindings into a candidate-independent GitHub App check.

This document authorizes design and later separately qualified implementation/configuration slices only. It does **not** mutate repository rules, install or create a GitHub App, modify workflows, enqueue or merge a trust-root candidate, access a founder private key, sign anything, establish the trust root, or execute artifact/runtime work.

Maximum result of this docs-only PR if merged:

```text
PHASE_B_SERVER_SIDE_ATOMIC_GATE_AUTHORIZATION=CANONICAL
```

It is not equivalent to:

```text
PHASE_B_SERVER_SIDE_ATOMIC_GATE=PROVEN
FOUNDER_PROCESS_AUTHORITY_TRUST_ROOT=CANONICAL_PROVEN
CURRENT_SESSION_PROCESS_AUTHORITY_PROOF=PASS
TRUSTED_GATE_OFFLINE_ARTIFACT_PACKAGE_PROVEN
B1_V2_IMPLEMENTATION=AUTHORIZED
H4_COMPLETE=YES
```

## 3. Primary-source capability basis

The selected design relies only on documented GitHub server-side primitives:

1. repository branch rulesets / branch protection can require pull requests, required status checks, conversation resolution, and block force pushes;
2. a required status check can require a specific GitHub App as the expected source;
3. required status checks can be strict with respect to the current base branch;
4. a repository-level rule can require merge queue;
5. merge queue evaluates required checks on a `merge_group` built against current target-branch state;
6. GitHub Apps can receive `merge_group.checks_requested` and report check results for the merge-group head SHA;
7. merge queue can require all queue entries to pass required checks and can limit the maximum number of PRs merged together.

If any required GitHub capability is unavailable for this repository at implementation time, the implementation must fail closed and return for a new authorization. No weaker client-only substitute is permitted.

---

## 4. Selected architecture

The authorized architecture is exactly two server-side enforcement layers plus candidate-independent immutable event receipts.

### Layer A — GitHub repository ruleset / protected-branch enforcement

Target:

```text
REPOSITORY=TheHalfMoon/Kodac
TARGET_BRANCH=main
CONTROL_PLANE=GitHub server-side repository rules
```

Required semantics:

```text
REQUIRE_PULL_REQUEST_BEFORE_MERGE=YES
REQUIRE_CONVERSATION_RESOLUTION_BEFORE_MERGE=YES
REQUIRE_STATUS_CHECKS_BEFORE_MERGE=YES
REQUIRE_MERGE_QUEUE=YES
BLOCK_FORCE_PUSHES=YES
BLOCK_BRANCH_DELETION=YES
CONFIGURED_BYPASS_ACTORS=0
```

The ruleset must also require the Kodac Phase-B check from one exact expected GitHub App source. A same-named status emitted by a user, workflow, token, or different App must not satisfy the requirement.

### Layer B — candidate-independent Kodac Phase-B GitHub App

Logical identity:

```text
GATE_LOGICAL_NAME=kodac-phase-b-gate
GATE_CHECK_NAME=kodac/phase-b-gate
EXECUTION_CLASS=GITHUB_APP_SERVER_SIDE_CHECK
CANDIDATE_REPOSITORY_CODE_AUTHORITY=NONE
```

The App implementation, credentials, installation configuration, receipt store, reviewer allowlist, and any App signing/credential material must not live in the trust-root candidate branch or in any path the trust-root candidate may modify.

The App must be the expected source of `kodac/phase-b-gate` in the repository rule.

The App must evaluate ordinary PR-head qualification and `merge_group.checks_requested`, but the merge-authoritative PASS is the check associated with the current merge-group head.

### Receipt-store boundary

The App's event receipts must use candidate-independent storage with these properties:

```text
RECEIPT_STORAGE_CLASS=CANDIDATE_INDEPENDENT
RECEIPT_CONTENT_ADDRESSING=SHA256
RECEIPT_APPEND_ONLY=REQUIRED
RECEIPT_MUTATION_AFTER_ISSUANCE=FORBIDDEN
RECEIPT_DELETION_AFTER_ISSUANCE=FORBIDDEN
RECEIPT_AUDIT_RETRIEVAL=REQUIRED
RECEIPT_DIGEST_BOUND_IN_PHASE_B_CHECK=REQUIRED
```

The later AG-1 proof must identify the concrete storage mechanism and show that the establishment candidate has no credentials or write path to it. If append-only semantics cannot be proven, the gate is not proven.

---

## 5. Why the architecture closes the PR #146 TOCTOU gap

The PR #146 defect came from treating mutable GitHub metadata as if a client-side read could be made atomic with a later merge request.

This authorization removes that assumption.

Merge-critical state is split into two categories.

### Category 1 — state GitHub itself enforces at merge time

```text
pull-request-only update path
required status checks
conversation resolution
merge-queue requirement
latest-base merge-group construction
force-push prohibition
branch-deletion prohibition
```

These predicates are not accepted from a client-side snapshot. They are repository rules evaluated by GitHub's merge control plane.

### Category 2 — Kodac-specific historical authorization events

```text
founder bootstrap approval event
fresh independent exact-head clean-review event
```

These are converted from mutable PR metadata into immutable, content-addressed receipts by the candidate-independent App. Once a valid receipt is issued for an exact head, the original comment/review object is no longer itself a continuously live merge predicate.

This distinction is required. Otherwise editing a comment after a check but before a merge would recreate the exact PR #146 race.

---

## 6. Founder bootstrap approval event receipt

Canonical PR #145 still requires the one-time top-level founder bootstrap approval comment on the frozen establishment head.

The future App must observe that event directly from GitHub and issue exactly one immutable receipt for the first valid approval event matching the exact frozen head.

Required observed comment lines remain:

```text
FOUNDER_TRUST_ROOT_BOOTSTRAP_APPROVAL=EXPLICIT
REPOSITORY=TheHalfMoon/Kodac
EXACT_HEAD=<exact frozen establishment head SHA>
TRUST_ROOT_ID_SHA256=<64 lowercase hex chars>
PUBLIC_KEY_SPKI_DER_SHA256=<64 lowercase hex chars>
ESTABLISHMENT_PREIMAGE_SHA256=<64 lowercase hex chars>
ESTABLISHMENT_NONCE_DISPOSITION_SHA256=<64 lowercase hex chars>
```

Required observed identity:

```text
COMMENT_AUTHOR_LOGIN=TheHalfMoon
COMMENT_TYPE=TOP_LEVEL_PR_COMMENT
COMMENT_PR=<exact establishment PR number>
COMMENT_REPOSITORY=TheHalfMoon/Kodac
```

Receipt schema:

```text
schemaVersion=kodac-phase-b-founder-bootstrap-receipt-v1
repository
pullRequestNumber
candidateHeadSha
commentId
commentCreatedAtUtc
commentAuthorLogin
commentBodySha256
trustRootIdSha256
publicKeySpkiDerSha256
establishmentPreimageSha256
establishmentNonceDispositionSha256
observedAtUtc
appInstallationId
appIdentity
```

Receipt identity:

```text
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_DOMAIN=kodac-phase-b-founder-bootstrap-receipt-v1
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_PREIMAGE=
  UTF8(FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_DOMAIN)
  || 0x00
  || RFC8785_JCS_UTF8(<strict receipt object>)
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_SHA256=sha256(FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_PREIMAGE)
```

Unknown fields and duplicate keys are forbidden.

The complete canonical receipt bytes must be stored under the receipt digest in the candidate-independent receipt store. The Phase-B check must expose or bind that digest so an auditor can retrieve the exact receipt consumed by the gate.

The receipt proves a historical founder approval event for one exact candidate head. Editing or deleting the source comment after a valid receipt is issued does not retroactively erase that already-observed event and is not used as a merge-time revocation channel.

There is no comment-based revocation protocol. If the founder intends to stop the candidate after issuing approval, the supported actions are to close/remove the PR from the queue or change the candidate head, both of which invalidate merge eligibility through GitHub's own PR/head state.

This event-to-receipt conversion is the explicit semantic repair that prevents mutable founder-comment state from recreating a TOCTOU predicate.

---

## 7. Independent exact-head review receipt

A qualifying independent review remains mandatory.

The App may recognize only an explicitly configured allowlist of independent reviewer identities established in the later AG-1 proof. The trust-root candidate cannot modify this allowlist.

A reviewer/provider is eligible for that allowlist only if the qualification proves:

```text
REVIEWER_IDENTITY_STABLE=YES
EXACT_HEAD_BINDING_OBSERVABLE=YES
TERMINAL_CLEAN_VERDICT_OBSERVABLE=YES
ACTIONABLE_FINDINGS_SURFACE=INLINE_REVIEW_CONVERSATION
TOP_LEVEL_ONLY_ACTIONABLE_FINDINGS=FORBIDDEN_FOR_QUALIFIED_PROVIDER
```

If a provider can emit a material actionable finding only as a top-level mutable summary with no merge-blocking review conversation, that provider is not sufficient for this gate unless a separately proven adapter converts such findings into a server-enforced blocking predicate.

The App must issue a clean-review receipt only after all of the following are true for the exact candidate head:

```text
REVIEWER_IDENTITY_ALLOWLIST_MATCH=PASS
REVIEW_BINDS_EXACT_HEAD=PASS
REVIEW_IS_FRESH_AFTER_LATEST_CANDIDATE_MUTATION=PASS
REVIEW_TERMINAL_VERDICT=CLEAN
ACTIONABLE_FINDINGS_AT_RECEIPT_TIME=0
```

Receipt schema:

```text
schemaVersion=kodac-phase-b-independent-review-receipt-v1
repository
pullRequestNumber
candidateHeadSha
reviewProviderIdentity
reviewRecordId
reviewRecordCreatedAtUtc
reviewRecordSha256
terminalVerdict
observedAtUtc
appInstallationId
appIdentity
```

Receipt identity uses the same domain-separated JCS + SHA-256 construction with domain:

```text
kodac-phase-b-independent-review-receipt-v1
```

The complete receipt bytes must be stored under the receipt digest in the candidate-independent receipt store and bound by the Phase-B check.

The review receipt is historical proof that a clean independent exact-head review completed. Later actionable findings must be represented as unresolved PR review conversations to be merge-blocking. `REQUIRE_CONVERSATION_RESOLUTION_BEFORE_MERGE=YES` is therefore mandatory and is not replaceable by the review receipt.

A top-level non-actionable summary update without an unresolved actionable review conversation does not retroactively invalidate an already-issued clean review receipt.

---

## 8. Required Phase-B App check contract

The App check name is fixed:

```text
kodac/phase-b-gate
```

The merge-authoritative check must run on `merge_group.checks_requested` and fail closed unless it proves at least:

```text
PHASE_B_GATE_SCHEMA_VERSION=kodac-phase-b-gate-v1
REPOSITORY_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
TARGET_BRANCH_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
ESTABLISHMENT_PR_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
CANDIDATE_HEAD_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
MERGE_GROUP_CONTAINS_EXPECTED_CANDIDATE_PROOF=PASS
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_PROOF=PASS
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_RECEIPT_STORAGE_PROOF=PASS
FOUNDER_BOOTSTRAP_EXACT_HEAD_PROOF=PASS
INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_RECEIPT_PROOF=PASS
INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_RECEIPT_STORAGE_PROOF=PASS
INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_EXACT_HEAD_PROOF=PASS
TRUST_ROOT_ID_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
ESTABLISHMENT_PREIMAGE_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
NONCE_DISPOSITION_BINDING_PROOF=PASS
FOUR_PATH_ESTABLISHMENT_DELTA_PROOF=PASS
FORBIDDEN_PATH_DELTA_ZERO_PROOF=PASS
REQUIRED_RULESET_IDENTITY_PROOF=PASS
REQUIRED_RULESET_CONFIGURATION_PROOF=PASS
EXPECTED_APP_SOURCE_PROOF=PASS
```

The check output must bind the exact founder-receipt digest, independent-review-receipt digest, App identity, installation identity, establishment PR number, exact candidate head, and merge-group head.

The App check must not claim the state of built-in GitHub predicates that GitHub itself enforces at merge time as a substitute for those rules. Redundant observation is allowed, but the server-side rule remains authoritative for conversation resolution and required status-check enforcement.

---

## 9. Merge-queue configuration theorem

The later configuration proof must establish a repository-level merge queue for `main`.

Required configuration:

```text
MERGE_QUEUE_REQUIRED=YES
MERGE_METHOD=MERGE
REQUIRE_ALL_QUEUE_ENTRIES_TO_PASS_REQUIRED_CHECKS=YES
MAXIMUM_PULL_REQUESTS_TO_MERGE_TOGETHER=1
MINIMUM_PULL_REQUESTS_TO_MERGE_TOGETHER=1
```

`MAXIMUM_PULL_REQUESTS_TO_MERGE_TOGETHER=1` is required to minimize ambiguity between independent landing decisions. It must not merely be assumed to make every synthetic merge-group object contain exactly one PR.

The AG-4 qualification must empirically prove the exact merge-group membership semantics seen by the App. If a `merge_group` can include additional PR content in a way that prevents exact candidate/base attribution under this configuration, qualification fails and a new authorization is required.

Build concurrency may be greater than one because it limits concurrent merge-group builds rather than the number of PRs merged together. It is not itself a security boundary.

The later proof must demonstrate that the required `kodac/phase-b-gate` check is requested for the merge group and that no merge occurs when that check is absent, pending, or failing.

---

## 10. Existing CI and merge-group compatibility

The establishment merge must remain subject to the existing required governance/runtime checks appropriate to the candidate.

GitHub documents that GitHub Actions checks required by a merge queue must support the `merge_group` event. Therefore the implementation phase must discover the exact current required check contexts and whether they already report on merge-group heads.

This authorization does not assume exact check-context names and does not authorize workflow mutation now.

Required discovery result before configuration:

```text
CURRENT_REQUIRED_CHECK_CONTEXT_DISCOVERY=PASS
MERGE_GROUP_COMPATIBILITY_DISCOVERY=PASS
```

If an existing required check does not report for `merge_group`, a separate narrowly scoped workflow-compatibility authorization is required before changing `.github/**`.

No silent workflow widening is allowed.

---

## 11. Ruleset / protection configuration requirements

The later server-side configuration proof must record and independently verify at least:

```text
RULESET_OR_PROTECTION_ID
RULESET_TARGET=main
ENFORCEMENT_STATUS=ACTIVE
REQUIRE_PULL_REQUEST=YES
REQUIRE_CONVERSATION_RESOLUTION=YES
REQUIRE_STATUS_CHECKS=YES
REQUIRE_MERGE_QUEUE=YES
BLOCK_FORCE_PUSHES=YES
BLOCK_DELETIONS=YES
CONFIGURED_BYPASS_ACTORS=0
PHASE_B_CHECK_NAME=kodac/phase-b-gate
PHASE_B_CHECK_EXPECTED_SOURCE=<exact GitHub App identity>
```

The proof must use live GitHub configuration reads after mutation. Screenshots or prose declarations are insufficient by themselves.

If GitHub exposes both classic branch protection and repository rulesets that overlap, the implementation must prove the effective combined rule state and must not assume that one UI surface supersedes the other.

---

## 12. Candidate-independence boundary

The trust-root establishment candidate must not be able to weaken the gate.

Therefore the establishment four-path allowlist remains exactly:

```text
1. provenance/kdo-h4-r4b-founder-process-authority-trust-root-v1.json
2. packages/kodac-runtime/test/helpers/kdo-h4-r4b-founder-process-authority-verifier.ts
3. packages/kodac-runtime/test/kdo-h4-r4b-founder-process-authority-trust-root.test.ts
4. docs/planning/KODAC_KDO_H4_R4B_FOUNDER_PROCESS_AUTHORITY_TRUST_ROOT_EVIDENCE_2026-08-21.md
```

The establishment candidate is forbidden from changing:

```text
.github/**
repository rulesets / branch protection
GitHub App installation or permissions
GitHub App source/configuration/deployment
required status-check expected source
merge-queue configuration
reviewer allowlists used by the App
server-side receipt storage
App credentials or signing configuration
```

Any such mutation belongs to a separate predecessor and invalidates establishment qualification until independently reconciled.

---

## 13. App provenance and credential boundary

AG-1 must bind the candidate-independent App to an exact implementation/deployment identity before it can become a required check source.

Required proof fields include:

```text
APP_GITHUB_ID
APP_SLUG_OR_CANONICAL_NAME
APP_INSTALLATION_ID
APP_SOURCE_PROVENANCE_ID
APP_SOURCE_EXACT_REVISION
APP_DEPLOYMENT_IDENTITY
APP_PERMISSION_SET
APP_WEBHOOK_EVENT_SET
APP_RECEIPT_STORAGE_IDENTITY
APP_REVIEWER_ALLOWLIST_SHA256
```

Permissions must be least privilege and separately justified. The App's private key, webhook secret, deployment credentials, receipt-store credentials, or equivalent secrets are forbidden from the Kodac repository, PR comments, CI logs, ChatGPT/agent context, and test fixtures.

No private App credential may be generated or handled by this docs-only authorization PR.

---

## 14. Administrative control-plane trust boundary

No GitHub repository rule can make a malicious organization owner cryptographically unable to change repository settings.

Therefore the exact threat model is explicit:

```text
CANDIDATE_CONTROLLED_BYPASS=FORBIDDEN_AND_IN_SCOPE
ORDINARY_WRITE_ACTOR_BYPASS=FORBIDDEN_AND_IN_SCOPE
MISCONFIGURED_RULESET_BYPASS=FORBIDDEN_AND_IN_SCOPE
WRONG_STATUS_CHECK_SOURCE=FORBIDDEN_AND_IN_SCOPE
MALICIOUS_GITHUB_ORG_ADMIN_CONTROL_PLANE=OUT_OF_SCOPE_TRUST_ROOT
GITHUB_PLATFORM_COMPROMISE=OUT_OF_SCOPE_TRUST_ROOT
```

The canonical founder / organization-administration control plane is a trusted external authority for establishing the gate. Configuration proof and audit evidence remain mandatory.

This limitation must not be hidden behind an absolute claim that GitHub administrators are technically incapable of disabling repository rules.

---

## 15. Future implementation/configuration slices

This authorization intentionally separates future work.

### AG-1 — GitHub App identity, provenance, and receipt-contract proof

May establish and prove:

```text
exact App identity
installation identity
exact source revision / deployment identity
minimum required permissions
webhook/event subscriptions
receipt schemas
receipt canonicalization
append-only receipt storage
candidate-head binding
reviewer allowlist and reviewer behavioral contract
fail-closed check semantics
```

It must not yet modify `main` merge rules unless separately included in the authorized configuration slice.

### AG-2 — repository ruleset / merge-queue configuration proof

May configure only the exact server-side controls authorized by this document after AG-1 is proven.

It must retain before/after configuration evidence and prove zero configured bypass actors.

### AG-3 — merge-group CI compatibility, only if required

If discovery proves current required checks do not report on `merge_group`, a new explicit authorization is required for exact workflow paths before any `.github/**` mutation.

### AG-4 — sacrificial qualification PR

A dedicated non-trust-root fixture PR must prove the complete server-side behavior before the real trust-root establishment PR proceeds.

The real trust-root establishment candidate is not the test fixture for the gate.

---

## 16. Required adversarial qualification matrix

AG-4 must prove at least:

```text
valid exact-head founder bootstrap event -> receipt PASS
wrong founder login -> receipt FAIL
wrong repository -> receipt FAIL
wrong PR number -> receipt FAIL
wrong candidate head -> receipt FAIL
malformed bootstrap body -> receipt FAIL
bootstrap body hash mutation -> receipt FAIL
receipt missing from append-only store -> gate FAIL
receipt bytes not matching digest -> gate FAIL
receipt overwrite attempt -> FAIL / NO MUTATION
valid independent exact-head clean review -> receipt PASS
wrong reviewer identity -> receipt FAIL
unqualified reviewer provider -> receipt FAIL
review bound to old head -> receipt FAIL
review with actionable finding -> receipt FAIL
provider that emits actionable finding only top-level -> NOT QUALIFIED
missing Phase-B App check -> MERGE BLOCKED
Phase-B App check pending -> MERGE BLOCKED
Phase-B App check failure -> MERGE BLOCKED
same-name check from wrong source -> MERGE BLOCKED
new unresolved review conversation -> MERGE BLOCKED
conversation resolved -> eligibility may recover only after all other gates pass
required CI failure -> MERGE BLOCKED
required CI pending -> MERGE BLOCKED
main movement -> new merge-group evaluation REQUIRED
direct merge outside merge queue -> BLOCKED
force push to main -> BLOCKED
main deletion -> BLOCKED
multiple-PR landing group -> BLOCKED / CONFIGURATION FAIL
candidate change after receipts -> old receipts INVALID
candidate attempts .github gate mutation -> establishment allowlist FAIL
candidate attempts ruleset/config mutation -> establishment qualification FAIL
```

The qualification must include negative tests; a successful happy-path merge alone is insufficient.

---

## 17. Gate proof artifact requirements

Before the real establishment candidate can start, a later canonical evidence package must bind at least:

```text
GATE_AUTHORIZATION_COMMIT=<canonical merge commit of this authorization>
GITHUB_APP_IDENTITY=<exact App identity>
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=<exact installation identity>
GITHUB_APP_SOURCE_EXACT_REVISION=<exact source identity>
GITHUB_APP_DEPLOYMENT_IDENTITY=<exact deployment identity>
GITHUB_APP_PERMISSION_SET_SHA256=<canonical permission-set digest>
GITHUB_APP_EVENT_SET_SHA256=<canonical event-set digest>
GITHUB_APP_REVIEWER_ALLOWLIST_SHA256=<canonical reviewer allowlist digest>
RECEIPT_STORE_IDENTITY=<candidate-independent store identity>
RECEIPT_STORE_APPEND_ONLY_PROOF=PASS

INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_RECEIPT_SCHEMA_SHA256=<schema digest>
PHASE_B_CHECK_NAME=kodac/phase-b-gate
PHASE_B_CHECK_EXPECTED_SOURCE=<exact App identity>
RULESET_OR_PROTECTION_ID=<live GitHub identifier>
RULESET_CONFIGURATION_SHA256=<canonical normalized configuration digest>
MERGE_QUEUE_CONFIGURATION_SHA256=<canonical normalized configuration digest>
SACRIFICIAL_QUALIFICATION_PR=<PR number>
SACRIFICIAL_QUALIFICATION_HEAD=<exact head SHA>
NEGATIVE_TEST_MATRIX=PASS
DIRECT_MERGE_BLOCK_PROOF=PASS
WRONG_SOURCE_BLOCK_PROOF=PASS
UNRESOLVED_CONVERSATION_BLOCK_PROOF=PASS
MAIN_MOVEMENT_REEVALUATION_PROOF=PASS
```

The evidence package must distinguish configuration stored in GitHub's control plane, App-side state, and ordinary repository Git blobs.

---

## 18. Prohibited shortcuts

The following do not satisfy this authorization:

```text
client-side double-read + expected_head_sha only
PR comment that merely says all gates passed
status check with expected source = any source
candidate-controlled GitHub Actions workflow as the sole Phase-B gate
checking founder comment live immediately before merge without receipt conversion
using editable founder comment state as a continuous revocation mechanism
mutable or candidate-controlled receipt storage
review provider whose material findings do not become server-blocking conversations
ignoring unresolved conversations because a clean review receipt exists
merge without merge queue
merge queue without merge_group Phase-B check
merge-group check that does not bind the exact establishment PR/head
configured bypass actors
using the real trust-root establishment PR as the first gate test
```

---

## 19. Public ceremony preservation

This gate work changes no signed founder preimage.

```text
TRUST_ROOT_ID_SHA256=d8a87fb2f17ecaeefd345f2d323b0776c0e51429f7a2dd7c78df6a6068535d98

ESTABLISHMENT_SIGNATURE_STATUS=UNCHANGED
PRIVATE_KEY_ACCESS=NO
SIGNING=NO
NONCE_RETIREMENT_REQUIRED=NO

RESIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```

Delay caused by gate implementation/qualification does not itself invalidate the establishment signatures.

## 21. Authorization PR merge gate

This docs-only authorization may merge only if:

---

## 22. Post-authorization state

If this document becomes canonical, the maximum claim is:

```text
PHASE_B_SERVER_SIDE_ATOMIC_GATE_AUTHORIZATION=CANONICAL
```

The state remains:

```text
PHASE_B_SERVER_SIDE_ATOMIC_GATE=NOT_PROVEN
FOUNDER_PROCESS_AUTHORITY_TRUST_ROOT_ESTABLISHMENT=BLOCKED
FOUNDER_PROCESS_AUTHORITY_TRUST_ROOT=NOT_PROVEN
ARTIFACT_PROCESS_EXECUTION=FORBIDDEN
```

The next safe action after canonicalization is AG-1 discovery/proof planning for the candidate-independent GitHub App identity, provenance, permissions, webhook surface, append-only receipt store, reviewer behavioral contract, receipt contracts, and server-side check source. It is **not** trust-root establishment.
