## 0. Reconciliation note — 2026-08-24

The research references and headline paper claims recorded below were checked
against their primary sources on 2026-08-24 and remain materially accurate.
This verification does not promote any research idea into an implementation
requirement or an authority-bearing plan.

The verification is pinned to these exact arXiv versions so later revisions do
not silently change the source snapshot:

- `2608.13331v1` — [abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13331v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2608.13331v1)

- `2504.01990v2` — [abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01990v2) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01990v2)

The Inherent research index and linked Faraday article were accessed on
2026-08-24; unlike the arXiv records above, that web page is not an immutable
versioned source.

The references below to the "active H4 sequence" and the direction to finish
that work first describe the 2026-08-16 sequencing context. PR #102 subsequently
merged at `adab893d8e122320f441ec9a85a77527d92fbd02`. At reconciliation time,
canonical `main` was commit
`29a20b710edafa520d5eb18b59f7614589229829` with tree
`3c1b8ce6acff3437309cf71ab5ea0455bf3151dd`.

The founder authorization
`KODAC-FOUNDER-REPO-LOCAL-CONTINUATION-2026-08-24` now permits safe repo-local
research, planning, and roadmap re-evaluation. This research record still does
not independently authorize implementation, external deployment, spending,
secret use, trust-root changes, or protected-lane work. Live repository state,
canonical plans, and the latest founder authorization remain controlling.

## 1. Founder direction preserved

The product name remains **Kodac**. `Times` / `TimesCode` is not the active rename.

Kodac should not become merely a better PR-review bot. The long-term target is a self-improving software-engineering intelligence system that can understand a repository, predict consequences of engineering actions, execute through specialized agents and tools, verify reality against prediction, remember outcomes, and improve from experience.

A concise long-term description is:

> **Kodac understands the repository, predicts the consequences of engineering actions, executes with specialized agents, verifies reality against prediction, remembers outcomes, and improves from experience.**

This future direction must not derail the active H4 sequence.

## 2. Product invariant: unlimited-by-design

Preserve the founder product invariant:

`NO_KODAC_IMPOSED_ARTIFICIAL_LIMITS`

Kodac should not impose arbitrary vendor-style review quotas, daily caps, file caps, waiting periods, trial exhaustion, or equivalent artificial restrictions.

This does **not** mean ignoring physical or safety constraints. The intended distinction is:

- artificial Kodac product limits: forbidden as a design principle;
- actual user compute limits: observable and schedulable;
- external provider quotas/rate limits: detectable and escapable through provider interchangeability/failover where possible;
- user-configured safety/resource budgets: permitted;
- trust/security/provenance/evidence constraints: must remain fail-closed and cannot be weakened for throughput.

Long-term architecture families associated with this invariant:

- local-first and static-first analysis lanes;
- self-hosted scheduler/runtime;
- BYOK/BYOM provider abstraction;
- provider health checks, circuit breakers, and failover;
- local inference;
- parallel review workers / swarms;
- work stealing;
- distributed worker pools;
- incremental review;
- content-addressed caching;
- progressive finding emission;
- deterministic static/compiler/symbolic/security/test lanes independent of LLMs;
- graceful degradation from multi-agent -> single-agent -> local-model -> static-only rather than arbitrary refusal;
- provenance and evidence attached to every lane and finding;
- weighted scheduling/backpressure based on real compute and task value rather than arbitrary product quotas.

CodeRabbit, Qodo, Cubic, Greptile, Graphite, Semgrep, CodeQL, Sonar, Snyk, and similar systems are competitors/references/donors where licensing and rights permit; they are not mandatory Kodac runtime dependencies.

## 3. Research reference: Training AI Scientists to Replicate Research / Faraday / Replica

Primary references:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13331v1
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2608.13331v1

Paper title: **Training AI Scientists to Replicate Research**.

Key paper facts captured from the paper reviewed on 2026-08-16:

- The authors introduce **Replica**, a task space of 310 paper-replication tasks from 100 ML and AI-for-science papers spanning 1990–2026.
- Each task redacts a results figure and asks an agent to reproduce the experiment under time/compute limits rather than merely copy the figure.
- The reward system uses auto-generated per-task rubrics and a coding-agent judge, with multiple judge samples to reduce variance.
- The rubric covers visual fidelity, reproduction of the scientific claim, implementation fidelity, use of compute budget, and scientific integrity.
- They post-train a 27B policy named **Faraday** using a modified GRPO recipe with turn-level credit assignment.
- Faraday uses a frontier coding agent as a tool (CAT: coding agent as a tool) rather than trying to replace the coding agent.
- The harness is deliberately simple: a small tool set, a container, a linear append-only conversation, parallel tool calls, and optional multiple coding-agent invocations.
- The reported result is that the trained policy can outperform stronger frontier coding-agent baselines on held-out replication tasks, suggesting that a learned higher-level policy can improve how a much larger coding agent is directed.
- The paper reports that prompt optimization alone does not recover the same gain, supporting the idea that post-training can teach transferable problem-solving behavior that prompt engineering does not fully reproduce.
- Qualitatively, Faraday more often implements the mechanism an experiment is supposed to test instead of hard-coding expected outcomes or taking shortcuts that flatter results.

### Implication for Kodac

The important pattern is not “build an AI scientist.” It is:

```text
high-level learned engineering policy
             |
             v
    frontier coding agents as tools
             |
             v
       real repository actions
             |
             v
   evidence + outcome evaluation
```

A future Kodac policy should be able to decide:

- which coding agent/model/tool to invoke;
- whether to run one agent or several in parallel;
- what to ask each worker to investigate;
- when to reset context or resume a prior worker;
- when to stop exploring and verify;
- when a result is an implementation shortcut rather than a faithful solution;
- how much compute is justified by expected value;
- how to learn from outcome data without weakening trust gates.

The strategic concept to preserve is **a learned engineer above coding agents**, not a fixed hand-authored orchestration graph forever.

## 4. Research reference: Agent Memory

Primary reference:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06052v4

Preserve the architectural interpretation that agent memory is not merely RAG or a vector database. Long-term Kodac memory should distinguish at least:

### Repository semantic memory

What the codebase means:

- architecture;
- modules;
- invariants;
- APIs;
- domain semantics;
- dependency relationships.

### Repository episodic memory

What happened:

- PR histories;
- failed and successful fixes;
- regressions;
- review trajectories;
- CI failures;
- security incidents;
- accepted/rejected findings;
- model/tool outcomes.

### Procedural memory

How this repository prefers work to be done:

- migration patterns;
- review procedures;
- proof strategies;
- testing conventions;
- security review methods;
- repository-specific skills.

### Agent-private memory

Specialized memories for security, correctness, testing, architecture, performance, and other agents.

### Shared evidence memory

A common evidence workspace with explicit read/write authority, provenance, conflict handling, deduplication, and deterministic identifiers where appropriate.

### Founder/team memory

Accepted decisions, rejected designs, product invariants, scope boundaries, and non-negotiable trust requirements.

Long-term research should also evaluate **learned memory policies**: what to store, retrieve, summarize, expire, deduplicate, or promote based on measured downstream utility.

## 5. Research reference: Foundation Agents

Primary reference:

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01990v2

Preserve this as a broad architectural checklist around:

- modular agent architecture;
- self-enhancement / continual evolution;
- multi-agent collective intelligence;
- robustness and safety.

Kodac should avoid becoming a brittle hand-designed collection of narrow agents whose restrictive interfaces limit exploration. Specialization is useful, but coordination should remain adaptable and evidence-driven.

A possible future conceptual stack:

```text
Repository -> perception/indexing/graph -> world model
                                      |
             +------------------------+------------------------+
             |                        |                        |
         Security                 Correctness              Architecture
           agent                     agent                    agent
             |                        |                        |
             +-------------------- shared evidence ------------+
                                      |
                                debate / judge
                                      |
                                 verification
                                      |
                                  provenance
                                      |
                                    memory
                                      |
                              self-improvement
```

## 6. Research direction: Inherent Labs and recursive collective self-improvement

Reference:

- https://inherentlabs.ai/research/training-to-replicate

Preserve the distinction:

> **self-improving != self-authorizing**

Kodac may eventually discover, propose, benchmark, and learn better strategies, prompts, routing policies, memory policies, tools, and agent compositions.

It must **not** silently grant itself new capabilities, expand a trust boundary, change governance, or mint stronger evidence claims merely because a learned policy prefers it.

A safe high-level loop is:

```text
Kodac performs work
      |
records outcome and evidence
      |
evaluates reviewer/agent strategy
      |
discovers weak strategies
      |
proposes alternatives
      |
benchmarks under controlled gates
      |
promotes only proven improvements
```

Self-improvement remains subordinate to explicit trust, provenance, evidence, and authorization rules.

## 7. Research reference: mHC

Primary reference:

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24880v2

This work is relevant primarily if Kodac eventually trains its own foundation or specialist models. Do not cargo-cult neural-network architectural ideas into agent orchestration.

Preserve as a future model-training research reference rather than a present product architecture requirement.

Potential future comparison set for learned encoders/models may include techniques such as:

- JEPA-style objectives;
- SIGReg and related anti-collapse regularization;
- VICReg;
- Barlow Twins;
- contrastive objectives;
- masked code modeling;
- graph prediction;
- next-state prediction.

Benchmark evidence, not aesthetic similarity, should decide adoption.

## 8. Research reference: LeWorldModel

Primary references:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.19312v3
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.19312v3

Paper: **LeWorldModel: Stable End-to-End Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture from Pixels**.

The direct implementation domain is visual control, not software engineering, so Kodac should **import the abstraction, not copy the implementation**.

The important abstraction is:

```text
current latent state + action -> predicted next latent state
```

### Kodac Repository World Model

A future Kodac analogue could represent repository state from structured software signals rather than pixels:

```text
Source
- AST
- symbols
- types
- imports
- dependency graph
- call graph

Behavior
- tests
- coverage
- runtime traces
- benchmarks
- build outputs
- failure signatures

History
- commits
- PRs
- previous fixes
- regressions
- review findings

Trust
- provenance
- security boundaries
- permissions
- sandbox evidence
- policy invariants

Intent
- specs
- issues
- acceptance criteria
- architectural decisions
```

A hybrid state encoder could combine graph structure, code embeddings, deterministic facts, and runtime state into a compact repository-state representation.

Then a dynamics predictor could approximate:

```text
z(repository_t) + z(engineering_action_t)
                 ->
z(repository_t+1)
```

This would enable future **counterfactual engineering**: evaluate likely consequences of candidate patches/refactors/test strategies before expensive or destructive execution.

## 9. Kodac Engineering Surprise

A particularly valuable world-model-derived signal is **violation of expectation / surprise**.

Concept:

```text
expected next state
        vs
observed next state
        |
        v
engineering surprise score
```

Examples:

- a small authentication refactor unexpectedly affects billing, database, serialization, and network-policy surfaces;
- a symbol rename causes a much larger blast radius than predicted;
- an agent modifies dozens of unrelated files;
- tests pass but runtime or dependency behavior diverges sharply from expected consequences;
- a security-sensitive change has an anomalous trajectory even though conventional checks remain green.

High surprise should not automatically mean “bug.” It should be a routing/calibration signal that can trigger:

- deeper verification;
- an independent reviewer;
- an alternate plan;
- static-analysis escalation;
- additional runtime evidence;
- human review when required.

This is a possible future source of advantage over review systems that only inspect the final diff.

## 10. Kodac Counterfactual Engineering

Preserve this future research concept:

Before executing an expensive or risky engineering action, Kodac may simulate or predict candidate consequences:

```text
candidate plan A -> predicted state A
candidate plan B -> predicted state B
candidate plan C -> predicted state C
                         |
                         v
                compare / calibrate
                         |
                         v
                 execute best plan
```

Possible predicted properties:

- affected files;
- dependency changes;
- likely tests/failures;
- security-boundary changes;
- compatibility impact;
- blast radius;
- latency/compute cost;
- probability of success;
- confidence/calibration uncertainty.

The predictor need not be perfect to be valuable, but its outputs must be calibrated and treated as predictions, never as evidence of what actually happened.

## 11. Kodac Experience Network

Do not store only final findings. Preserve complete engineering trajectories where governance and privacy permit.

A future experience record may contain:

```text
problem
context
repository state
agent/model/tool identities
strategy
hypotheses
commands/actions
observations
evidence gathered
finding
confidence
reviewer disagreement
developer action
tests
merge outcome
future regression
final utility
```

The long-term learning loop becomes:

```text
PR / task
   -> trajectory
   -> outcome
   -> calibrated utility
   -> memory
   -> policy / routing / skill improvement
```

Signals may include whether a finding was accepted, rejected, fixed, later confirmed by a regression/incident, or shown to be noisy.

## 12. Adaptive compute, not artificial quotas

Unlimited-by-design should be paired with intelligent scheduling rather than wasteful scheduling.

Kodac should eventually learn or estimate:

- which agents are useful for which surfaces;
- which files deserve deep analysis;
- where disagreement has value;
- when deterministic/static analysis is enough;
- when a second model is worth the cost;
- when a swarm is beneficial;
- what can be served from verified memory/cache;
- when local models are sufficient;
- when provider failover is needed.

A useful design phrase is:

> **Unlimited by policy. Adaptive by intelligence. Bounded only by real compute, user policy, and trust/safety requirements.**

## 13. Proposed future research track

Do not create these packages or milestones merely because this document exists. They are a research queue to be authorized later.

Suggested umbrella: **Kodac Learned Intelligence (KLI)**

- `KLI-1` Repository State Representation
- `KLI-2` Engineering Action Representation
- `KLI-3` Repository Dynamics Model
- `KLI-4` Counterfactual Planning
- `KLI-5` Engineering Surprise
- `KLI-6` Trajectory Anomaly Detection
- `KLI-7` Outcome-Calibrated World Model
- `KLI-8` Learned Engineering Policy Above Coding Agents
- `KLI-9` Experience Replay / Continual Improvement
- `KLI-10` Small Local Intelligence Models
- `KLI-11` Learned Routing and Adaptive Compute
- `KLI-12` Learned Memory Policies
- `KLI-13` Multi-Agent Private/Shared Memory
- `KLI-14` Continuous Evaluation and Strategy Promotion
- `KLI-15` Distributed Worker / Swarm Scheduling

Every KLI item should require an explicit benchmark and promotion gate before becoming production authority.

## 14. Non-goals for the active H4 sequence

This research document does **not** authorize any of the following during the current H4 work:

- creating a world-model package;
- training Kodac models;
- adding a self-improvement loop;
- expanding runtime privileges;
- changing the R3G-A authorization;
- creating the R3G-A evidence ledger early;
- weakening deterministic evidence/provenance;
- adding a mandatory third-party SaaS dependency;
- merging an active PR without its canonical gate.

The correct sequencing remains: finish the currently authorized H4 work first, then reconcile future architecture into canonical planning through explicit founder authorization and normal repository governance.
