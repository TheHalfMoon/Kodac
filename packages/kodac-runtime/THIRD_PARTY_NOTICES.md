## DeepSeek Harness Landlock launcher adaptation

Portions of `native/landlock-run.c` are adapted from:

- Project: DeepSeek Harness / node-addon-landlock-run
- Repository: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness
- Pinned commit: `47f943859bef60e4160492346772ded9b24f765a`

Kodac modifications include an explicit `kodac-linux-landlock-fs-v1` claim-set boundary, machine-readable functional probe output with observed ABI, Kodac-specific failure prefixes, and separation between the isolated native primitive and the non-executing TypeScript adapter. H4-R2B does not wire this launcher into Kodac production execution.

## HKUDS DeepCode tool-result pruning adaptation

Portions of `src/agent/tool-result-pruning.ts` are behaviorally ported and adapted from:

- Project: DeepCode
- Repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode
- Pinned commit: `287510fbf6820147a48adf79f7fd86b0ed1afe92`
- Pinned tree: `7f44b320f86d04d4315242fabc74f1b325829be8`

Kodac modifications include a TypeScript implementation, strict reuse of canonical H2 model-visible message validation, UTF-8 byte rather than character-count limits, deterministic structural SHA-256 identities for policies/changes/results, hostile structural-input rejection, and an explicit R1A boundary that leaves the agent loop and H2 session/event projection unchanged.

## HKUDS DeepCode consecutive repeat-call signal adaptation

Portions of `src/agent/repeat-call-signal.ts` are behaviorally ported and adapted from:

- Project: DeepCode
- Repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode
- Pinned commit: `287510fbf6820147a48adf79f7fd86b0ed1afe92`
- Pinned tree: `7f44b320f86d04d4315242fabc74f1b325829be8`

Kodac ports only the consecutive same-tool/same-input chain concept. The implementation replaces DeepCode's mutable tracker and permissive argument stringification with an explicit serialized state transition, strict JSON/JCS-compatible canonicalization, bounded UTF-8 inputs, domain-separated SHA-256 structural identities, and evidence-safe structural signals. DeepCode's model-visible reminder text, raw argument preview, runner integration, and hard-stop semantics are not ported.

The MIT license text and upstream copyright notice reproduced in the immediately preceding HKUDS DeepCode section apply to this adaptation as well.

## HKUDS DeepCode guarded tool-pipeline contract adaptation

Portions of `src/agent/guarded-tool-pipeline.ts` are an architectural/behavioral port of selected hook-fold and runner contract ideas from:

- Project: DeepCode
- Repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode
- Pinned commit: `287510fbf6820147a48adf79f7fd86b0ed1afe92`
- Pinned tree: `7f44b320f86d04d4315242fabc74f1b325829be8`
- Runner reference: `core/agent_runtime/runner.py`
- Runner blob: `645ab82f768214cce0794984c4bc9b92b099ce5a`
- Lifecycle reference: `core/agent_runtime/hook.py`
- Lifecycle blob: `b0bbe5ea880f8688306a348ca72f2a29d4ffc9cc`
- Matcher reference: `core/harness/hooks/events.py`
- Matcher blob: `ed393156d9e53d543220387fa4421785a0ce0b83`
- Fold reference: `core/harness/hooks/engine.py`
- Fold blob: `26f66a1199057077372e26d831f58e7d54bf5d89`
- Root license blob: `b3ba37ce442298d5bdec96e2e52a8a812a25f123`
- License: MIT
- Upstream copyright: Copyright (c) 2025 Data Intelligence Lab@HKU

Kodac deliberately does not port DeepCode's shell-command hook execution, workspace-discovered executable callbacks, permission-hook allow authority, completion-order last-writer rewrite semantics, post-hook evidence mutation, or stop-hook continuation authority. R3A reduces inert serialized declarative decisions through a deterministic monotonic state transition: tools may only be removed, calls may only be blocked, and same-tool/same-capability input rewrites always create new structural identities and require later K2 re-evaluation before any active execution integration.

The MIT license text and upstream copyright notice reproduced in the earlier HKUDS DeepCode section apply to this adaptation as well.

## wrtnlabs/agentica validation-feedback design reference

R3A also studies the validation-feedback design described by:

- Project: Agentica
- Repository: https://github.com/wrtnlabs/agentica
- Pinned commit: `dc91f4307a3f2ee25e1ee07cf48777fcd13b6b0d`
- Reference path: `website/content/docs/concepts/function-calling.mdx`
- Reference blob: `9e5577511d65369e8439a958683b81e541dc87ee`
- License: MIT
- LICENSE blob: `886b7e88682164a5a22e609120c9f96c9ea57216`
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2025 Wrtn Technologies
- Intake mode: STUDY_ONLY

No Agentica runtime source or dependency is copied or imported by H5-R3A. Kodac adopts only the design lesson that argument/schema validation failures can improve recovery feedback. In Kodac's authority model, validation failure may narrow/block a future tool call, while validation success never grants permission and can never bypass K2.
## github/spec-kit specification contracts adaptation

Portions of `src/specification/contracts.ts` are behaviorally ported and adapted from:

- Project: spec-kit
- Repository: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
- Pinned commit: `e79fa25f3f465b1ce779f570ccacef7b379e9166`
- Source paths: `templates/commands/specify.md`, `templates/commands/plan.md`, `templates/commands/tasks.md`, `templates/commands/analyze.md`, `templates/commands/converge.md`, `templates/spec-template.md`, `templates/plan-template.md`, `templates/tasks-template.md`
- License: MIT (as declared by the in-source DONOR_PROVENANCE block; no separate upstream copyright line is declared in the Kodac source)
- Intake mode: PORT

Kodac reimplements a TypeScript contract surface with Kodac-owned limits and identities guided by these templates.
